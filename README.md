### 👋 Hi, I'm Ved.

I work at the intersection of consumer data & tech to build ML systems **to help customers**. I also write about effective data science, learning, and career **to help readers**. Currently a Data Scientist at Urbanclap solving some core problems in marketplace.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Automating ML & Lead Score and Productivity Loss.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more DL, Designing Scalable Systems, and how to communicate data-science effectively in org and public speaking. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with `applied-ml` in startups.
